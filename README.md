# Item Marketplace DApp

This is a decentralized application (DApp) built using **React**, **Bootstrap**, and **Vite**. It provides an interface for interacting with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows users to list, edit, purchase, and manage items, while providing additional features like generating reports, withdrawing funds, and viewing the contract owner.
